          <p>The GOATx DeFi exchange was built from the ground up for cryptocurrency token traders on the Binance Smart Chain.  GOATx was created 
            by developers experienced in stock and commodities trading with beginner, intermediate, and professional traders in mind.  Unlike previous DeFi
            exchanges like Uniswap and Pancakeswap, GOATx provides token collectors and traders with accounting, tracking and analytic tools
            traders expect.  GOATx uses the MasterChef and liquidity pool smart contracts from Pancakeswap to provide over $3.4B in token liquidity 
            while giving users tools they expect from trading platforms like RobinHood, eTrade, or TD Ameritrade.</p>
          <p>Unlike centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase that are operated by a single, corporate entity, decentralized 
            exchanges (DEXs) allow for trading without an intermediary. Due to the expensive transaction fees on Ethereum, GOATx is focused 
            on BEP-20 tokens found on the Binance Smart Chain. </p>

          <h3 class="text-white mb-2">What is GOATx</h3>
          <p class="text-white">GOATx is a decentralized exchange that allows you to trade cryptocurrencies and tokens without a centralized intermediary, 
            keeping custody of your tokens all the while. It is built on automated smart contracts deployed on Binance Smart Chain, the 
            blockchain platform run by crypto exchange Binance. GOATx provides an easy to use interface with trading tools that would be
            expected by stock traders but are lacking in most DeFi exchanges.</p>
          <p class="text-white">Like many other DEXs, GOATx is built on an automated market maker (AMM) system, which relies on user-fueled liquidity 
            pools to enable crypto trades. Rather than dealing with an order book and finding someone else who wants to swap the 
            tokens you have for the ones you want, users lock their tokens into a liquidity pool via smart contracts. That allows 
            you to make the swap you want, and users who keep their coins in the pool earn rewards all the while.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-2">How does GOATx work?</h3>
          <p>Token swaps take place via liquidity pools between token pairs. Users are able to exchange one type of token for 
            another without an intermediary, while other users who stake their tokens in the liquidity pools earn a share of 
            the rewards generated by transactions.</p>

          <h3 class="text-white mb-2">What is special about GOATx?</h3>
          <p class="text-white">GOATx is built with a focus on user experience.  The biggest complaint about DeFi exchanges is that they are not 
            user friendly and they do not provide tools to help the user track their portfolio. When you begin using GOATx, you 
            immediately have access to portfolio management features for every trade you have ever made on the Binance Smart Chain
            including BNB and all BEP-20 tokens. </p>

          <h3 class="mb-2">Getting Started with GOATx</h3>
          <p>You will need your own crypto wallet to use GOATx, as the DEX does not support fiat currency. GOATx works with wallets 
            such as Trust Wallet and MetaMask. Although MetaMask was originally only an Ethereum wallet, it can be easily configured 
            to work with Binance Smart Chain. Unlike centralized exchanges, you won’t have to input a bunch of personal data—you don’t 
            even have to create a profile.</p>
          <p>You can get instructions for installing and configuring Metamask <b><a [routerLink]="['/getstarted']">here.</a></b></p>
