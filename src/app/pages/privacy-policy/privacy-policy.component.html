              <p>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><b>Location Data.</b></p>
                  <p>To help us protect against fraud, provide our services to you, and improve our services, we
                    collect location data, including current and historical information concerning a user’s
                    geographic location, GPS location, transaction location, and IP addresses that they use in
                    conjunction with our Services. We collect your precise location data with your permission,
                    and use that information, for example, to help protect against fraud by detecting and
                    declining debit card transactions that may occur far away from your device’s location. We
                    collect information about your location through GPS, Wi-Fi, wireless network
                    triangulation, or other methods in order to obtain your location. We may also approximate
                    your location by your IP Address. We also use the Google Maps API to gather information
                    about your location. Google uses various technologies to determine your location,
                    including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with
                    information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers (see Google’s Privacy
                    Policy to learn more).</p>

                  <p><b>Usage and Device Data Collected Automatically Through Tracking Technologies.</b></p>
                  <p>To provide a personalized and enhanced user experience, we, and our third-party
                    partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit or use our
                    Services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this
                    information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects,
                    web beacons, embedded scripts, location identifying technologies, file information, and
                    similar technology (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”). For example, we collect
                    information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type,
                    Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time
                    stamp, a unique ID (that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device, or
                    your account), and other similar information. We use Tracking Technologies to help ensure
                    that you have a high-quality experience on our Services. We also use Tracking
                    Technologies to aid in the targeted advertising of our services on other platforms. From
                    your device manufacturer, we also may collect the names of other third-party applications
                    that you have downloaded on your device.</p>
                  <p>If you prefer, you can change your cookie settings. Some browsers have options that allow the
                    user to control whether the browser will accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify the user each
                    time a cookie is sent. You may elect to reject cookies by adjusting your settings, but doing so will
                    limit the range of features available to you on our Services and other websites. Be sure to read
                    any information provided by your browser developer to understand the limitations of these
                    settings, as they may differ from browser to browser and may not apply to all technologies. You
                    may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain
                    technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email, used our
                    Services, or performed certain functions with it.</p>
                  <p>Our Services also occasionally use “local shared objects” (also known as “Flash cookies”). Like
                    browser cookies, Flash cookies may be used for coordinating content delivery, website
                    functionality, maintaining preferences, advertising, or analytics. Unlike browser cookies, “Flash
                    cookies” are not stored in the browser. You may be able to manage these Flash cookies by visiting
                    the Adobe website here.</p>
                  <p>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers transmit “do-not-track”
                    signals to websites. We currently don’t take action in response to these signals.
                    Personal Information from Other Sources and Third Parties:</p>

                options on our Services. We permit third-party online advertising networks, social media
                companies, and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our Services
                over time so that they may play or display ads on other websites, apps, or services you may use,
                and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for
                interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies. For
                advertising, we may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) or
                hashed data with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and
                our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online on other
                platforms more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such
                as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.</p>
              <p>We’re not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, and the information
                practices of these third parties are not covered by this Policy. Some of these companies are
                members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad

                and when you use our Services on your browser or mobile device, log in to your account on our
                Services, or otherwise engage with us. We share a unique identifier, like a user ID or hashed email
                address, with Google to facilitate the Services. Google Analytics allows us to better understand

            <h3 id="notice" class="policy-title">7. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h3>
            <div class="policy-wrapper">
              <p>This section provides additional details about the personal information we collect about California
                residents and the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).</p>
              <p>Please note that the CCPA does not apply to what is referred to as nonpublic personal information
                collected by financial institutions (like GOATx), as that information is subject instead to other
                financial privacy laws. As a result, the CCPA does not apply to most of the information that
                GOATx collects.</p>
              <p>Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the CCPA provides California residents the right to
                request more details about the categories and specific elements of personal information we
                collect, to delete their personal information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and
                to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. We do not sell information about you to
                third parties. In order to help GOATx deliver advertising and marketing on other platforms, we
                do allow third parties to collect information through our Services. Please see the “Third-Party
                Tracking and Online Advertising” section above for more details, including choices available to
                you.</p>
              <p>In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information subject to the
                CCPA: identifiers (such as email address and IP address), approximate geolocation information,
                and Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as browsing history and related
                usage data). For more details about the information we collect and the categories of sources of
                this information, please see the “Types of Information Collected and How We Collect Them”
                section above. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the
                “Disclosure of Personal Information” section above.</p>
              <p>California residents may make a consumer rights request for access to certain personal
                information subject to the CCPA, not otherwise exempted as nonpublic personal information
                collected by financial institutions, by sending an email to ccpa-request@GOATx.com. We may
                verify the request by asking you to provide information that matches information we have on file
                about you. You can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf,
                but we will require proof that the person is authorized to act on your behalf and may also still ask
                you to verify your identity with us directly.</p>
